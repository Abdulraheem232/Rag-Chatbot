# 💬 RAGChatBot – AI Chatbot Powered by Java Notes PDF

**RAGChatBot** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [GroqChat](https://groq.com/), and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It answers questions based on the contents of a **Java Notes PDF**, providing accurate and context-aware responses about Java programming.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ragchatbot.git
cd ragchatbot
````

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

## 📄 Add Your Java Notes PDF

Place your `java_notes.pdf` file in the root directory (or update the path in your loader script accordingly).

---

## ▶️ Running the Chatbot

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8501`

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Load PDF**: Text is extracted and split from the Java Notes PDF.
2. **Vector Embeddings**: The text chunks are embedded and stored in a vector store.
3. **Question Answering**: When a user asks a question, relevant chunks are retrieved and used as context for the Groq LLM.
4. **Response Generation**: The model generates a detailed response based on both the question and document context.
